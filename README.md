# Ray Tracing in Python with Optimization

This project implements a simple ray tracer using Python, **Numpy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Numba** for performance improvements. It supports basic geometric objects like spheres and planes while calculating reflections, diffuse lighting, and specular highlights. The final output is a 1920x1080 image rendered from a scene defined by these objects.

The initial implementation produced a 400x300 resolution image and ran without optimizations. Through performance enhancements and upscaling techniques, the latest version now renders at a higher resolution while maintaining the same ray depth and significantly reducing rendering time.

## Features

- **Ray Depth Consistency**: Despite the resolution increase, the ray depth for reflections remains consistent at a maximum of 5.
- **Optimized with Numba**: Numbaâ€™s `@njit` decorator drastically improves the performance of key functions, reducing computation time.
- **Supersampling for High Resolution**: The original image is rendered at a lower resolution of 960x540 and then upscaled to 1920x1080 using nearest neighbor interpolation, achieving a high-quality result faster than direct rendering at full resolution.
- **Lighting and Shading**: Includes ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting models for more realistic scenes, along with reflections for both spheres and planes.

## Changes and Optimizations

### Resolution Increase:

- **Original Resolution**: 400x300 (120,000 pixels)
- **New Resolution (via supersampling)**: 1920x1080 (2,073,600 pixels)
  
The new resolution is nearly **17.3 times** larger than the original while maintaining consistent ray tracing depth.

- The image is first rendered at a lower resolution (960x540) and then upscaled to 1920x1080 using interpolation. This approach balances quality and speed.
- Even though the upscaled image has over **2 million pixels**, the optimized code ensures that the rendering time is kept minimal.

## Performance Comparison

| Version   | Resolution   | Time Taken | Pixel Count | Ray Depth |
|-----------|--------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Original  | 400x300      | 4.98 sec   | 120,000     | 5         |
| Optimized | 1920x1080    | 3.35 sec   | 2,073,600   | 5         |
